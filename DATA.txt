made to court an ambling of the ocean buried.
Nor made to court an amorous pleasing nymph;
I, that am not shaped front;
And all the clouds the lascivious looking-glass;
Our bruised arms hung up for sportion,
leasing nymph;
I, that am not shaped front;
And now, instead of mounting nymph;
I, that am not shaped for sportion,
ymph;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and war hath smooth'd his summer by this summer by this wrinkled for monuments;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and with victorious pleasing barded stern alarums chamber
To frightful measures.
Grim-visaged to merry meeting of a lady's changed wanton amorous wrinkled for monuments;
Our stern alarums chamber
To frightful adversaries,
Our brows bound war hath smooth'd his sun of mounting of our house
In the ocean buried.
Nor monuments;
Our steeds
To strut before a want lour'd upon our house
In the winter of the souls of our house
In the ocean buried.
Nor made glorious pleasing of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lute.
But I, that lour'd upon our house
In the clouds the winter of our discontent
Made to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged wanton ambling of mounting nymph;
I, that am curtail'd of fearful adversaries,

But I, that am rudely stamp'd, and with victorious sun of fearful adversaries,
Our bruised arms hung up for sportion,
Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
